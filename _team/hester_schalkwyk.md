Dr. Hester van Schalkwyk is a Postdoctoral Researcher on the Microbiome Green Revolution project, with expertise in plant-microbe interactions, microbial ecology, and bioinformatics. Her work integrates field experiments, laboratory assays, and high-throughput sequencing to understand how microbial communities influence crop health and disease suppression. She completed her PhD in Plant Pathology at the University of the Free State (South Africa) in 2018, with complementary training at the John Innes Centre and the Earlham Institute in Norwich, UK. She was a recipient of the Monsanto Beachell-Borlaug International Scholars Program (MBBISP) scholarship for her doctoral research, alongside BBSRC funding. She has since worked in host-microbe research, including microbiome studies on cereals and horticultural crops.

Dr. Bryony Dignam is a Postdoctoral Researcher in Plant-Soil Microbial Ecology. Through plant host-directed selection, Dr Dignam is leading the engineering and optimisation of soil microbiomes for reduced disease incidence and enhanced crop yield. She is exploring the microbial community dynamics that underpin the development of these beneficial microbiomes. Bryony completed her PhD with AgResearch and Lincoln University, New Zealand, and was awarded an AGMARDT (NZ) postdoctoral research fellowship for her project “Soil organic matter and the soil immune response”. Her PhD and post-doctoral research has focused on identifying sustainable farm management practices that improve soil organic matter quality and increase the diversity of plant growth promoting microbes.
